Photobleach
===========

Simple Python Code for counting photobleach events and specifying their exact time.

Currently this repository holds the code as it existed when it was used for the publication http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/early/2016/09/19/mbc.E16-06-0404.full.pdf+html
plus some minor modifications to improve speed and usability.

This includes the core evaluator/estimator and auxiliary routines, but not the iterator that optimizes parameters, which is part of the Machine Learning shell. 

The full Machine Learning version will become available on September 1st, 2017, following review by one of the funding agencies.
At that point in time this file will be replaced by a Jupyter notebook with a full presentation of the project.
