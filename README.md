Photobleach
===========

Simple Python Code for counting photobleach events and specifying their exact time.

Currently this repository holds the code as it existed when it was used for the publication http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/early/2016/09/19/mbc.E16-06-0404.full.pdf+html
plus some minor modifications to improve speed and usability.

This includes the core evaluator/estimator (i.e the cost function) and auxiliary routines, but not the iterator that optimizes parameters, which is part of the Machine Learning shell. 

A Jupyter notebok will be uploaded by July 4th at the latest, containing a full presentation/description of the scientific problem and explaining the use and function of this code.

A full Machine Learning version with this code at its core is described in a publication which is currently under peer review. As soon as the review is complete the ML version will be published in this repository. This will happen irrespective of whether the review is positive or negative with regards to publication in the reviewing journal; since I am no longer in academia I do not really care that this be published in a journal, so if it is rejected I wil just put it here.
